Installation Notes
------------------

This tutorial will require recent installations of *[NumPy](http://www.numpy.org)*, *[SciPy](http://www.scipy.org)*,
*[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org)*, *[scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)* and *[IPython](http://ipython.readthedocs.org/en/stable/)* together with the *[Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org)*.

The last one is important, you should be able to type:

    jupyter notebook

in your terminal window and see the notebook panel load in your web browser.
Try opening and running a notebook from the material to see check that it works.

For users who do not yet have these  packages installed, a relatively
painless way to install all the requirements is to use a Python distribution
such as [Anaconda CE](http://store.continuum.io/ "Anaconda CE"), which includes
the most relevant Python packages for science, math, engineering, and
data analysis can be; Anaconda can be downloaded and installed for free
including commercial use and redistribution.  
The code examples in this tutorial should be compatible to Python 2.7,
Python 3.4, and Python 3.5.

After obtaining the material, you should run ``python check_env.py`` to verify
your environment.

Downloading the Tutorial Materials
----------------------------------

I would highly recommend using git, not only for this tutorial, but for the
general betterment of your life.  Once git is installed, you can clone the
material in this tutorial by using the git address shown above:

    git clone git://github.com/amueller/odsc_east_2016.git

If you can't or don't want to install git, there is a link above to download
the contents of this repository as a zip file.
